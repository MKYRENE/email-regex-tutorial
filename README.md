# Regex Tutorial: Matching an Email Address

This tutorial explains a specific regular expression for validating email addresses. Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for defining search patterns in strings, widely used in web development. By breaking down each component of the regex, we'll understand how it functions to validate email addresses.

## Summary

The regex we'll explore is: `^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$`

This regex validates email addresses by checking the local part, the @ symbol, and the domain. The tutorial covers each component's purpose to create the search pattern.

## Components of the Regex

### The Local Part

`([a-z0-9_\.-]+)`: Matches the local part before @, ensuring valid characters are present.

### The @ Symbol

`@`: Simply matches the @ symbol in an email address, acting as a separator.

### The Domain

`([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})`: Matches the domain and TLD, ensuring their validity.

## Conclusion

This tutorial provides an in-depth understanding of the regex for validating email addresses. Regex is essential for data validation in web development.
